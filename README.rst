RoboHash
========

The source code for `RoboHash.org`_.

It basically copy/pastes various robot pictures together, using bits
from the SHA hash. It's not perfect, and not entirely secure, but it
gives a good gut-check to "Hey, this SHA is wrong."

Install
-------

Just the library:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install robohash

Or if you also want the web frontend:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install robohash[web]

Usage
-----

.. code:: python

    from robohash import Robohash

    hash = "whatever-hash-you-want"
    rh = Robohash(hash)
    rh.assemble(roboset='any')
    with open("path/to/new/file.png", "wb") as f:
        rh.img.save(f, format="png")

Robosets
--------

RoboHash comes with five image sets, named "set1", "set2", "set3", "set4" and "set5".
Specify which set you want in the ``assemble()`` method. Alternatively,
specify the string "any", and RoboHash will pick an image set for you,
based on the provided hash.

   Make sure to create a serverless NEG (network endpoint group) during LB configuration


Disclaimer
----------

OK, I'll admit I'm a crappy programmer. Compounding this, I wrote this
code initially to be internal-only. It's ugly, and could be a LOT nicer.

Sorry about that.
